# ISOBEL üê∂

  Welcome! Isobel is a beginner friendly NodeJS framework for fetching data from
  your social profiles and other sources, for display in your own apps and
  websites.
</span>

![Diagram](./guides/diagram.svg)

Isobel periodically fetches data from the services that you teach
her, so the data is always there when you need it.

A great example is Twitter, which gets the latest posts from your Twitter feed. Once configured, you can access the JSON for your latest tweets at a defined URL, so you can display them on your website. That means no worrying about API rate-limiting or quotas, and no making API calls from your frontend (a big no-no).

Isobel includes a bunch of premade services, but you can also create your own.

## Minimum Implementation

```javascript
const ISOBEL = require("@isobel/core");
const fileSystem = require("@isobel/file-system");
const nasa = require("@isobel/nasa");
const toMs = require("to-ms");

// initialise
const Isobel = new ISOBEL({
  cache: fileSystem,
  services: [
    {
      name: "nasa",
      func: nasa.fetchPhotoOfTheDay, // gets the NASA photo of the day
      interval: toMs.hours(24)
    }
  ]
});

Isobel.start().catch(error => {
  console.error("Error:", error);
  process.exit(1);
});
```

Once Isobel is up and running, you can access your data in a JSON at a specific URL. e.g `localhost:4000/get/nasa`

```json
{
  "url": "https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1911/jC-L-TM_SunFinal5HRweb1024.jpg",
  "hdurl": "https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1911/jC-L-TM_SunFinal5HRweb.jpg",
  "explanation": "On November 11, 2019 the Sun was mostly quiet, experiencing a minimum in its 11 year cycle of activity. In fact, the only spot v..."
}
```
